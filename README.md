## What you will need.

You will need to download Xcode 13 either from the [App store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) or from [Dev.Apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/).


## Seeing the tutorial

You can run the project by clicking on the Xcode project file. When it opens it will fetch the Documentation Package that contains the tutorial _(If this fails, you may need to add your git credentials to Xcode from its settings)_

Once the Swift Package finishes the download, you can press `CMD`+ `Control` + `Shift` + `D` to compile the docs and open the tutorial.
