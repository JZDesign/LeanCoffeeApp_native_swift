# LeanCoffeeApp Native Swift

This is the root project where you'll learn how to create a mobile application on iOS with SwiftUI.

## What you will need.

You will need to download Xcode 13 either from the App store or from [Dev.Apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/download/all).

## Seeing the tutorial

You can run the project by clicking on the xCode project file. When it opens it will fetch the Documentation Package that contains the tutorial _(If this fails, you may need to add your git credentials to xCode from its settings)_

Once the Swift Package finishes the download, you can press `CMD`+ `Control` + `Shift` + `D` to compile the docs and open the tutorial.
