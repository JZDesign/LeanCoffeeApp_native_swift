## What you will need.

You will need to download Xcode 13 either from the [App store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) or from [Dev.Apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/).


## Seeing the tutorial

You can run the project by clicking on the Xcode project file. When it opens it will fetch the Documentation Package that contains the tutorial _(If this fails, you may need to add your git credentials to Xcode from its settings, if it still fails, it's usually related to your ssh configuration. Ask me and I'll help you with it.)_

Once the Swift Package finishes the download, you can press `CMD`+ `Control` + `Shift` + `D` to compile the docs and open the tutorial.

### Warning about going Split Screen on your Laptop

As of right now the mobile experience will not always show all of the changed lines of code for a step in the tutorial. Going split screen on a laptop with Xcode + Apple Docs will usually put you into the mobile experience.

### You can click -> [here](https://github.com/JZDesign/LeanCoffeeService) to view the API Docs.

## Using Xcode Previews

From a `*.swift` file:

- To open the preview canvas you can press `option` + `cmd` + `enter`
- To build/resume the preview you can press `option` + `cmd` + `p`
